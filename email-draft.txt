Great question about MySQL. The short answer: your MySQL database stays exactly as it is. Supabase sits alongside it as a dedicated AI layer — it handles vector search, semantic embeddings, and the knowledge graph, while MySQL continues running your platform, content management, and user accounts. A lightweight sync function keeps the two in step, so there's no migration, no downtime, and no changes to your existing codebase.

I've added two slides to the deck that lay this out visually — one showing what each database handles, and one showing how they connect. Take a look and let me know if anything needs clarifying.
